init vars
int *a, *b, *c;
if(master)
	a = malloc 
	b= all space
	c= all space
else
	a= malloc
	b = malloc column
	c= malloc column

comm
---------
if(master)
	init matrix
	print A, print B;
	these sends can be unblocked
	send A to everyone
	send chunk of B to everyone
else
	receive 2 things from master

comp
----------
if(!master)
	do computations for my part of c
	build my c

barrier
----------
all procs need to catch up this

print
----------
if not master, send with blocking your part of c to master

if master receive with blocking
	print matrix

cleanup
--------
free
each process will do its own freeing
